# Question

Provide an example a pair of classes that would create a "has-many / belongs-to" relationship.

# Answer
an example that would create a has-many/ belongs to relationship would be a song and playlist 

```js 

// build the class that would belong to the things that has many things

/*BELONGS-TO*/

class Song {
    constructor(artist, title, duration) {
        this.id = getId();
        this.artist = artist;
        this.title = title;
        this.duration = duration
    }
}

export default Song;

/*HAS-MANY*/

export class Playlist {
    static #allPlaylists = [];
    static #allSongs = [];

    constructor(name, description, id, duration = 0) {
        this.name = name
        this.description = description
        this.id = getId()
        this.duration = duration
        Playlist.#allPlaylists.push(this)

        this.name = name; // Array to store books
        Playlist.#allPlaylists.push(this);
    };

    addSong(id, artist, title, duration) {
        const song = new Song(id, artist, title, duration)
        Playlist.#allSongs.push(song);
        return song
    };

    getAllSongs() {
        return [...Playlist.#allSongs];
    };

    static getAllSongsInPlaylist() {
        return [...Playlist.#allPlaylists];
    }

}

export default Playlist; 

```
